# DSCI-Forest-Cover
Maryville University data science master's program capstone project using Python and the Kaggle Forest Cover data set. [Working notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alisonhawke/dsci-598-final-submission) available on Kaggle's website.

Jupyter notebook files showing a six week solo project using the Kaggle [Forest Cover data set](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction). The goal was to produce models and validate them against the Kaggle competition.

Notebooks included are:

* Data visualisation, data analysis, and feature importance
* Four models containing:
    * Logical regression
    * Logical regression with cross validation
    * Decision tree
    * Random Forest (score: 0.73306)
* Random Forest with Principal Component Analysis (score: 0.73977)
* Support Vector Machine (score: 0.58006)
* K Nearest Neighbours (score: 0.61554)
* Neural Network (score: 0.52131)
* XGBoost Classifier (score 0.71989)
* XGBoost parameter tuning (score 0.73775)
* Extra Trees with feature changes (score 0.77866)

This project was completed in the 2023 Fall semester.
